# Presidential Election Outcome Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the outcome of the U.S. Presidential Election using sentiment analysis on tweets. The sentiment of tweets mentioning the candidates is analyzed to forecast election results. Machine learning models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression were used to classify sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral, and ultimately predict the winning candidate.

## Project Goals
- **Predict the winner of the presidential election** based on public sentiment expressed on Twitter.
- **Analyze public opinion trends** using social media data.
- **Compare different machine learning models** for sentiment analysis and classification accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language used for the project.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Used for text analysis and sentiment classification.
  - Libraries: NLTK, VADER, TextBlob
- **Machine Learning**: 
  - Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation.
  - Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.
- **Data Visualization**: 
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing sentiment distributions and election predictions.
  - Dash and Plotly for interactive dashboard creation.
    
## Sentiment Analysis
- **Text Preprocessing**: 
  - Tokenization, removal of stop words, stemming, and lemmatization were applied to the tweet text.
- **Sentiment Classification**: 
  - The sentiment of each tweet was classified as positive, negative, or neutral using the VADER sentiment analysis tool.
- **Model Training**: 
  - A combination of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models were trained on the sentiment-labeled data.
  - The models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
